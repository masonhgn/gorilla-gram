# gorilla-gram

Integrates a Django backend with a simple post model with image and caption fields. Users can create an account, post pictures, 
and view other posts on their feed. Users can have their own profile associated with their own unique username, similar to Instagram. This project allowed me 
to further explore Django and MVC architecture in general, and gave a deeper understanding of what it takes to create a full stack user account based application.
